# CPU-Scheduler-Simulator
This project is a CPU Scheduler Simulator that demonstrates various process scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. The simulator allows users to visualize how different scheduling techniques manage processes and CPU execution.
Features
✅ Supports multiple scheduling algorithms:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF)
Round Robin (RR)
Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
Multilevel Queue Scheduling
✅ Simulates process execution with arrival time, burst time, and priority.
✅ Computes important scheduling metrics such as:

Waiting Time (WT)
Turnaround Time (TAT)
Response Time (RT)
✅ Provides a graphical or textual representation of process execution.
✅ User-friendly input system for adding and modifying processes.
