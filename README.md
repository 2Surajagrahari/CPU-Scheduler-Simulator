<h1>Project Overview</h1>

The CPU Scheduling Simulator is a Python-based tool designed to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms. The project aims to provide a clear understanding of scheduling techniques by visually representing process execution, turnaround times, and CPU utilization. It is beneficial for students, researchers, and professionals who want to analyze CPU scheduling behaviors in an interactive manner.

This project is a CPU Scheduler Simulator that demonstrates various process scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. The simulator allows users to visualize how different scheduling techniques manage processes and CPU execution.
Features


✅ Supports multiple scheduling algorithms:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF)
Round Robin (RR)
Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
Multilevel Queue Scheduling
✅ Simulates process execution with arrival time, burst time, and priority.
✅ Computes important scheduling metrics such as:

Waiting Time (WT)
Turnaround Time (TAT)
Response Time (RT)
✅ Provides a graphical or textual representation of process execution.
✅ User-friendly input system for adding and modifying processes.
